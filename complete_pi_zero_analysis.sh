echo "1️⃣ What does 'Killed' mean?"
echo "   The process was killed by the OS due to insufficient memory"
echo "   when trying to load DINO-L (1.2GB model) on your Pi"
echo ""

echo "2️⃣ Can DINO be quantized and deployed?"
echo "   ✅ DINO-S (small): ~84MB → ~21MB INT8 → ~10.5MB INT4"
echo "   ✅ DINO-B (base): ~344MB → ~86MB INT8 → ~43MB INT4"
echo "   ❌ DINO-L (large): Too large for Pi Zero (1.2GB)"
echo ""

echo "3️⃣ Did everything work out?"
echo "   ✅ Fixed benchmark worked perfectly"
echo "   ✅ Memory measurements now accurate (no more 0.0 MB)"
echo "   ❌ Comprehensive DINO crashed on DINO-L"
echo "   ✅ Created lightweight benchmark to avoid crashes"
