# Run it once after cloning the repository on a new machine (local or server).

# This command checks if 'git-lfs' is not in the system's command path.

# --- Step 2: Initialize LFS for the user and repository ---
# 'git lfs install' configures your global Git config to use LFS. It's safe to run multiple times.
echo "Initializing Git LFS..."
git lfs install

# --- Step 3: Set which file types to track ---
# This command tells Git LFS to manage any file ending in '.pth'.
# It modifies the '.gitattributes' file. This is also safe to run multiple times.
echo "Ensuring .pth files are tracked by LFS..."
git lfs track "*.pth"

# --- Step 4: Add the configuration file to Git ---
# The '.gitattributes' file contains the tracking rules and MUST be part of the repository.
# This ensures anyone who clones the repo automatically uses LFS for the right files.
