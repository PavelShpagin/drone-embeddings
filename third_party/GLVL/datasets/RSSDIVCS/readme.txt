
As RSSDIVCS is the integration of multiple publicly open datasets including UCM, RSI, NWPU and so on, you may need to cite the corresponding papers, which depends on the public policy of the orignal datasets. In addition to the image data, we also provide the category-level semantic representations in RSSDIVCS. If you find the RSSDIVCS dataset helpful in your research, please cite the following related works in your paper.
