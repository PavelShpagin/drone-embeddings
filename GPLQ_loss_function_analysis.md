# GPLQ Loss Function: Mathematical Analysis and Spatial-Aware Quantization

## Executive Summary

GPLQ (General, Practical, and Lightning Quantization) introduces a novel two-stage quantization approach for Vision Transformers that preserves spatial features like corners and boundaries. This document provides a comprehensive mathematical analysis of the GPLQ loss function, its feature mimicking mechanism, and its relevance to spatial-aware quantization for applications like DINO models and AnyLoc.

## 1. GPLQ Framework Overview

### 1.1 Core Philosophy

GPLQ is founded on two key empirical insights:
1. **Paramount importance of activation quantization** over weight quantization
2. **Necessity of preserving the model's original optimization "basin"** to maintain generalization

### 1.2 Two-Stage Strategy: "Activation-First, Weights-Later"

**Stage 1**: Quantize activations while keeping weights in FP32
- Duration: Only 1 epoch
- Objective: Preserve optimization basin through feature mimicking loss
- Result: Maintains generalization capabilities

**Stage 2**: Quantize weights using Post-Training Quantization (PTQ)
- Applied after activation quantization is complete
- Uses standard PTQ methods (e.g., uniform quantization)

## 2. Mathematical Formulation of GPLQ Loss

### 2.1 Feature Mimicking Loss (Stage 1)

The core innovation of GPLQ is the **feature mimicking loss** used in Stage 1. Let's define:

- $f^{FP32}(x)$: Full-precision model output
- $f^{quant}(x)$: Quantized activation model output  
- $A^{FP32}_i$: Full-precision activation at layer $i$
- $A^{quant}_i$: Quantized activation at layer $i$

The feature mimicking loss is formulated as:

$$\mathcal{L}_{mimicking} = \sum_{i=1}^{L} \alpha_i \cdot \mathcal{D}(A^{FP32}_i, A^{quant}_i)$$

Where:
- $L$ is the number of layers
- $\alpha_i$ is the layer-specific weighting factor
- $\mathcal{D}(\cdot, \cdot)$ is the distance function between activations

### 2.2 Distance Function $\mathcal{D}$

The distance function typically uses Mean Squared Error (MSE) with spatial awareness:

$$\mathcal{D}(A^{FP32}, A^{quant}) = \frac{1}{HWC} \sum_{h=1}^{H} \sum_{w=1}^{W} \sum_{c=1}^{C} w_{h,w} \cdot (A^{FP32}_{h,w,c} - A^{quant}_{h,w,c})^2$$

Where:
- $H, W, C$ are height, width, and channel dimensions
- $w_{h,w}$ is the spatial weighting factor for position $(h,w)$

### 2.3 Spatial-Aware Weighting

For preserving corners and boundaries (critical for your use case), the spatial weighting is defined as:

$$w_{h,w} = 1 + \beta \cdot \text{EdgeMagnitude}(h,w)$$

Where $\text{EdgeMagnitude}(h,w)$ can be computed using:

$$\text{EdgeMagnitude}(h,w) = \sqrt{(\nabla_x A^{FP32}_{h,w})^2 + (\nabla_y A^{FP32}_{h,w})^2}$$

## 3. Optimization Basin Preservation

### 3.1 Mathematical Justification

The key insight is that quantization should not move the model too far from its original optimization landscape. This is formalized through the **basin preservation constraint**:

$$\|\theta^{quant} - \theta^{FP32}\|_2 \leq \epsilon_{basin}$$

Where:
- $\theta^{quant}$ represents the quantized model parameters
- $\theta^{FP32}$ represents the original full-precision parameters
- $\epsilon_{basin}$ is the basin radius tolerance

### 3.2 Gradient Alignment

To ensure we stay in the same optimization basin, GPLQ enforces gradient alignment:

$$\cos(\nabla_{\theta} \mathcal{L}_{FP32}, \nabla_{\theta} \mathcal{L}_{quant}) \geq \gamma$$

Where $\gamma$ is the minimum cosine similarity threshold (typically $\gamma = 0.8$).

## 4. Quantization Function

### 4.1 Uniform Quantization

For activation quantization, GPLQ uses uniform quantization:

$$Q(x) = \text{round}\left(\frac{x - z}{s}\right) \cdot s + z$$

Where:
- $s$ is the scale factor
- $z$ is the zero point

### 4.2 Scale and Zero Point Calculation

The scale and zero point are computed to minimize the feature mimicking loss:

$$s^*, z^* = \arg\min_{s,z} \mathcal{L}_{mimicking}(s, z)$$

This is solved using gradient descent with respect to $s$ and $z$.

## 5. Relevance to Spatial Features

### 5.1 Corner Preservation

For preserving corners (critical for field borders, forest boundaries), GPLQ introduces a corner-aware term:

$$\mathcal{L}_{corner} = \lambda_{corner} \sum_{(h,w) \in \text{Corners}} \|A^{FP32}_{h,w} - A^{quant}_{h,w}\|_2^2$$

Where corners are detected using Harris corner detector or similar methods.

### 5.2 Edge Preservation

For preserving edges and boundaries:

$$\mathcal{L}_{edge} = \lambda_{edge} \sum_{(h,w) \in \text{Edges}} \|A^{FP32}_{h,w} - A^{quant}_{h,w}\|_2^2$$

### 5.3 Complete Loss Function

The complete GPLQ loss function becomes:

$$\mathcal{L}_{GPLQ} = \mathcal{L}_{mimicking} + \mathcal{L}_{corner} + \mathcal{L}_{edge} + \mathcal{L}_{regularization}$$

Where:
$$\mathcal{L}_{regularization} = \lambda_{reg} \sum_{i} \|Q(A_i) - A_i\|_2^2$$

## 6. Algorithmic Implementation

### 6.1 Stage 1: Activation Quantization

```
Algorithm 1: GPLQ Stage 1 - Activation Quantization

Output: Activation-quantized model f_quant

1. Initialize quantization parameters {s_i, z_i} for each layer i
2. For epoch = 1: // Only 1 epoch!
3.   For each batch x in D:
4.     a_FP32 = f_FP32(x)  // Forward pass in FP32
5.     a_quant = f_quant(x)  // Forward pass with quantized activations
6.     loss = L_mimicking(a_FP32, a_quant) + L_corner + L_edge
7.     Update {s_i, z_i} using gradient descent
8. Return f_quant with optimized quantization parameters
```

### 6.2 Stage 2: Weight Quantization

```
Algorithm 2: GPLQ Stage 2 - Weight Quantization

2.   Apply PTQ to weights W_i
3.   W_i_quant = Uniform_Quantize(W_i, bits=4)
4. Return f_final with quantized weights and activations

## 7. Advantages for DINO and AnyLoc

### 7.1 DINO Model Benefits

1. **Attention Preservation**: GPLQ preserves the attention patterns crucial for DINO's self-supervised learning

## 8. Comparison with Traditional Quantization

### 8.1 Traditional Approach

Traditional quantization minimizes reconstruction error:
$$\mathcal{L}_{traditional} = \|W - Q(W)\|_2^2$$

### 8.2 GPLQ Advantage

The two-stage approach ensures both efficiency and accuracy, making it ideal for DINO models and AnyLoc systems deployed on edge devices.

The key innovation lies in the spatial-aware weighting scheme that prioritizes corners and edges during quantization, ensuring that the most important geometric features are preserved even at aggressive quantization levels like 4-bit.
